## Other TODOs
* Ensure check licences from any other libs - can massively tidy up python deps
* Add a TODO on the client bit and tie back here
* Tidy up any python / JS that may now be defunct
* Ensure any dataframes etc required to run the code are in this repo (i.e. no paths to projects or other repos files in code..)
* Ensure any queries that have been loaded to graphDB are loadable fresh from code
* Try and avoid a new user needing to make a secret

## Limitations of model
* Doesn't explicitly call out the obvious shock, e.g. "if no petrol products from gulf, then no petrol products on sale for public" - it's more focused on how shocks create other shocks.
