## Other TODOs
* Ensure check licences from any other libs - can massively tidy up python deps
* Add a TODO on the client bit and tie back here
* Tidy up any python / JS that may now be defunct
* Ensure any dataframes etc required to run the code are in this repo (i.e. no paths to projects or other repos files in code..)
* Ensure any queries that have been loaded to graphDB are loadable fresh from code
* Try and avoid a new user needing to make a secret
